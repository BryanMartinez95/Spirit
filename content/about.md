<h1>About</h1>
<p>Welcome to my personal website! My name is Bryan Martinez and here you will find a lot of things programming related. I will be writing mainly about things ranging from architecture, Javascript, HTML, CSS, .NET framework, database concepts, testing, or just new intersting things. </p>
<h2>Background</h2>
I was first introduced into the world of programming in 2014 . I am currently in the 3rd year of the Bachelor of Applied Information Systems Degree program at NAIT in Edmonton. Before NAIT I took the Information Technology diploma majoring in Software development at SAIT. Currently, I work remotely as a web developer at Resource Energy Solutions, a company based in Calgary. The main reason why I decided to get my degree was because I still wasn't sure what I wanted to specialize in. Recently, I discovered that becoming a software architect would be really intersting as I love designing and building systems. Right now im trying to learn as many things as I can to become closer to becoming a reputable software architect.


<b>Specialties:</b> C#, ASP.NET MVC5, Entity Framework 6, LESS, KnockoutJS, SQL, Javascript, HTML5, CSS3

<b>Other languages I have worked with include:</b> JavaEE, Spring Boot, Hibernate, PL/SQL, Oracle 11g, Bootstrap, JQuery

<b>Currently Learning:</b> Angular 2 & ASP.NET Core

<h2>Personal</h2>
As for outside programming im a pretty simple guy. I spend a lot of my spare time watching a lot of anime or playing games with my friends. I have been told I can be a pretty sarcastic but patient person. I can be pretty quiet at first but if you get to know me really well I can be quite talkative.
