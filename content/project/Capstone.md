<h1>Capstone - Recursive Delegation 2016</h1>

At my time at SAIT I spent a year working on a Capstone project. This capstone project was done with a group of 4 in which we were called Recursive Delegation. This Capstone serves as a milestone to show our growth at our time at SAIT. Our client was a researcher for the Applied Research and Innovation division at SAIT.

<h3>The Problem</h3>
Our clients issue was that he was spending too much time gathering data from different sources and spending too much time on report generation. An estimated 8-16 hours a week was spent gathering data and generating reports when the clients time could be spent much more effeciently.

<h3>Our Solution</h3>
Our Solution was to create a web-based application that automatically collects and centralizes all the clients data in a centralized location for visualization aswell as automatic report generation.
