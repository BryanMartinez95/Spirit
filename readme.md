Spirit
=========

Spirit is the source code for my personal website that is built using Hugo.

Spirit is used as a website for me to post various things organized into sections:

Blog: A section used to share my thoughts about different things <br/>
Experiments: A section I use to fiddle with various things<br/>
Projects: This section is dedicated to show all the projects I have and am currently working on.<br/>
Learn: This section is used to share and teach interesting concepts and things I have learned<br/>
About Me: A section that describes who I am

Spirit is currently in development and is hosted at:
